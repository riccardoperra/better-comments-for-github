## Project structure

The project structure is organized in a monorepo using pnpm workspaces. The structure is still WIP and doesn't 
respect yet the best practices (root folder is a package itself too), but it will be improved in the future.

- **brand**: contains the branding assets, such as logos, promotional assets published in web store.
- **markdown-schema**: a package that contains the markdown proseMirror nodes used by the editor.
- **markdown-transformer**: a package that contains the logic to transform the markdown schema into ProseMirror and vice
  versa.
- **extension**: the browser extension package, responsible to load the editor in the GitHub pages.
- **src**: the core of the editor
